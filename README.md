# Magnetically-controlled autonomous robot

This battery-run robot car is operated with a PS4 controller or the Powerfist.
It can also run in autonomous mode, where it follows black lines and carries small objects.

The script attached packages and routes data from the chosen device to a microcontroller through a serial port.
The microcontroller is part of a transmitter which uses the magnetic field to communicate with the robot.

## Powerfist
The Powerfist is a handheld accelerometer that allows the user to control the car using hand movements.
An LED matrix is attached to the other hand to indicate the direction that the car is being told to move in.
